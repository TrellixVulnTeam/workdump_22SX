## Unix
see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)

> Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that follow certain [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix#Standards) (e.g., [Single UNIX Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unix_commands), [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)).

## Unix Philosophy
see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)

> The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors composability as opposed to monolithic design.

Peter H. Salus in A Quarter-Century of Unix (1994):

1. Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
2. Write programs to work together.
3. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

----
## Unix Shell
see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)

> The most generic sense of the term shell means any program that users employ to type commands. A shell hides the details of the underlying operating system and manages the technical details of the operating system kernel interface, which is the lowest-level, or "inner-most" component of most operating systems.

> All Unix shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.
